;;
;; NOTES:
;;
;; + Must run `doom sync` after modifying this file
;;
;; + Doom-specific functions/macros to help configure packages:
;;   - `load!',
;;   - `use-package!'
;;   - `after!' <-- use this to set up packages when possible, to prevent
;;                  settings overriding.
;;   - `add-load-path!'
;;   - `map!'
;;
;; TODOS:
;;
;; + `persp-mode' doesn't play nicely with `uniquify' and thus the `workspaces'
;;   doom module sets the `uniquify-buffer-name-style' to `nil'. However, this
;;   means if we visit two files with the same name, we end up with the ugly
;;   <1>, <2>, ... garbage, rather than the much nicer defaults that we should
;;   have. Also, `persp-mode' means that `C-x b' doesn't work as nicely as I'd
;;   like (in particular, buffers like `*scratch*' and `*Messages*' and such
;;   just completely disappear). So yeah overall, I've just disabled
;;   `persp-mode' by disabling `workspaces' module. However, this also means all
;;   the nicety around reloading sessions is gone. Might be nice to figure out
;;   how to get that back.
;;
;; + Is there a more DoomEmacs specific alternative for "C-'" (i.e.,
;;   `xref-find-definitions-other-window'). "M-." is assigned to
;;   `lookup/definition' which seems nicer, so probably there is a version for
;;   other-window too?
;;
;; + Doom Emacs's `ido' module messes with `~` behavior. I should try to switch
;;   it back. Relevant portion, search for `ido-file-completion-map' in
;;   `ido/config.el'
;;
;; + (Maybe) Enable line numbers everywhere, rather than just the selective
;;   places it tends to right now
;;
;; + Migrate my old TeX/LaTeX/AucTeX config.
;;
;; + Migrate my old Python config.
;;
;; + Migrate my old Org config.
;;
;; + Migrate my old magit config.
;;
;; + Consider introducing elmacro?
;;
;; + Fix show-paren highlighting behavior. Search for `show-paren-match' below.
